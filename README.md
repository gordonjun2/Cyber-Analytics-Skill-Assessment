# Cyber-Analytics-Skill-Assessment

## Installation Tips

1. For Task A. Automation Scripting, install [cyobstract](https://github.com/cmu-sei/cyobstract), [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), and [whois](https://pypi.org/project/python-whois/).
2. For Task C. Analytics Development, download the [http.log](https://www.secrepo.com/maccdc2012/http.log.gz) and extract it to get ***http.log***. Then, move the ***http.log*** into the ***logs-processing*** folder.

## Extra Notes

- Task A, B, and C are performed with little domain knowledge.
- Due to the lack of domain knowledge for Task C, suspicious IP addresses are not yet shortlisted. However, the submitted code may help to get clues on which IP addresses may be suspicious.
